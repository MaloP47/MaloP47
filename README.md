👋 Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently a student at 42 Paris, where I'm diving into the fascinating world of computer technology and information systems. Alongside my studies, I serve as the Commercial Manager for the school's Junior Enterprise, [Junior 42 Paris](https://junior42.com/), where I apply my skills in management, coaching, and customer service.

🎓 My academic background also includes a degree in law from Université Jean Moulin (Lyon III), providing me with a strong foundation in law and political science.

💼 Prior to venturing into the tech world, I spent 6 years at Burberry, where I climbed the ranks to become a Department Sales Manager. I was recognized as EMEIA top talent and played a key role in the reopening of flagship stores in Paris and London.

🏈 Outside of the professional realm, I have a passion for American football, having played for over 7 years with [Flash La Courneuve](https://www.flashfootball.org/), participating in several national elite finals and semi-finals, and European Football League in 2015. 🏒 Continuing my sports career, I now play in a national french recreational hockey league. 

🌐 I'm fluent in French and English, with limited working proficiency in Spanish.

🎖️ My commitment to excellence is reflected in my achievements and approach to life: "Excellence, in any field, requires full dedication."

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to learn more about my work or collaborate on an exciting project!
